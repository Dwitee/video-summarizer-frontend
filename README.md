# ReMindMap Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

This is the frontend for **ReMindMap**, a web application designed to make audio/video content more accessible, especially for neurodiverse users and those with communication difficulties such as aphasia.

The frontend allows users to upload or record videos, which are then processed by a Flask-based backend for summarization and mindmap generation.

## Features

- Upload or record video/audio in-browser
- Extracts audio using `ffmpeg.wasm` on the client ( currently this is done in backend)
- Sends audio to Flask backend for:
  - Transcription (via Whisper)
  - Summarization (via T5 or Gemini)
  - Mindmap generation
- Displays:
  - Time-stamped chapter summaries
  - Interactive and aphasia-friendly mind maps
  - Auto narration with adjustable speed
  - Fullscreen mindmap view with emoji and narration text
- Mobile handoff via QR code for mindmap viewing

##  Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
